            <h1>THE STORY</h1>
            <p>
              Our story is a bit of a saga, and I also happen to be the sort of writer who loooooves details, so if you intended to read our story in a minute or two I must do my bridely duty and instruct you to go make yourself a cup of tea, or maybe a strong cocktail, and nestle in for a tale that&apos;s, while not yet old as time, definitely on par with a Disney classic or two.
            </p>

            <p>Ready? Okay!</p>

            <p>
              Ted and I met while performing in <i>Happy Days: The Musical</i> at Tacoma Musical Playhouse in the spring of 2012. Looking back, it&apos;s fun to realize how our fated rendezvous only happened as the result of several fortuitous events:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>We both developed a crazy love for musical theater (Ted while in college and me while about 5 years old after becoming obsessed with a certain VHS of the musical, Annie)</li>
              <li>Ted met Brad Walker, a fellow actor and now friend (who I also ironically enough knew from college)</li>
              <li>Brittni decided that despite starting a new job in Seattle she was still totally game to drive 40 minutes every day to rehearsal in Tacoma</li>
              <li>Ted had yet to experience what happens when you perform in one too many ‘50s-era musicals</li>
              <li>Jon Rake decided to take a total chance and hire some crazy college kid he&apos;d never met before, but who he heard could sing like a total boss</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              I happened to already be in a relationship at the time, but couldn&apos;t help but think that this sweet guy Ted, one of the ‘Seattle boys&apos; as they were affectionately known within the Happy Days cast, was pretty gosh darn cute. But he was in COLLEGE and I had a BOYFRIEND and all the girls figured his dance partner had a total crush on him, so I considered him a friend. And then one night at karaoke he sang R. Kelly&apos;s <i>I Believe I Can Fly</i>, which was followed by my subconscious shoving Ted Adams out of the ‘friend zone&apos; and into another category entirely that we&apos;ll call &lsquo;potential.&rsquo;
            </p>

            <p>
              Happy Days came and Happy Days went. Crinolines were ruffled, cute boys were teased and after the show closed Ted chatted me up and said we should get lunch sometime. After all, we both lived in Seattle.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was around this time that Ted decided to journey into adulthood a bit earlier than the rest of us and buy a house. One of his main requirements in finding his first home was that there had to be a good kitchen and space to have dinner parties. Well, he found just that in Newcastle, WA and the summer after Happy Days he moved in.
            </p>

            <p>
              After meeting for lunch, Ted invited me over so he could try out his new kitchen. I must have impressed him with my mad cooking skillz (not to mention the crazy amount of food I consumed&hellip;which he commented on&hellip;and I took as a compliment) because not long after our first dinner he invited me over for another meal&hellip;and then another&hellip;and another. These were all casual themed meals with friends (think French night! Italian night! Sushi night!), but it didn&apos;t take long for my girlfriends to start poking around, asking those questions girlfriends are supposed to ask.
            </p>

            <p>
              <i>
              &ldquo;You&apos;re spending a lot of time with Ted, Brittni&hellip;what&apos;s up?&rdquo;
              <br />
              &ldquo;Wait&hellip;you&apos;re going to another dinner at Ted&apos;s house?&rdquo;
              <br />
              &ldquo;Oh you&apos;re busy this weekend&hellip;with Ted!?&rdquo;
              </i>
            </p>
             
            <p>
              My answer to all of these queries was <i>&ldquo;Oh we&apos;re just friends! He doesn&apos;t like me like that&hellip;&rdquo;</i> Inside, however, I always followed that statement by asking myself <i>&ldquo;&hellip;or does he?&rdquo;</i>
            </p>

            <p>
